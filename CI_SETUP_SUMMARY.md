## GitHub Workflows Created

### Core Workflows

1. **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Runs on: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
   - Jobs: Lint, Test, Build, E2E, Security, Dependencies
   - Ensures code quality before merge

2. **Preview Deployments** (`.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml`)
   - Runs on: Pull requests
   - Deploys to Vercel preview environment
   - Comments preview URL on PR

3. **Production Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`)
   - Runs on: Push to main branch
   - Full test suite before deploy
   - Database migrations
   - Creates GitHub release

4. **Security Analysis** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
   - Runs on: Push, PR, Weekly schedule
   - CodeQL security scanning
   - Reports to Security tab

5. **Database Backup** (`.github/workflows/database-backup.yml`)
   - Runs on: Daily at 2 AM UTC
   - PostgreSQL backup to S3
   - 30-day retention policy
   - Failure notifications

6. **Dependency Updates** (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
   - Weekly dependency checks
   - Grouped updates
   - Auto-merge for patches

## Required GitHub Secrets

Add these to your repository settings:

### Application
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`

### Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

### Backup (Optional)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `S3_BACKUP_BUCKET`

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: 
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets**: Add all required secrets in GitHub repository settings

3. **Verify Workflows**: Check Actions tab after push to ensure workflows run

4. **Add Status Badges**: Add workflow badges to README.md:
   ```markdown
   [![CI](https://github.com/cooperwalter/recipe-keeper/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cooperwalter/recipe-keeper/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
   [![CodeQL](https://github.com/cooperwalter/recipe-keeper/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cooperwalter/recipe-keeper/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)
   ```
