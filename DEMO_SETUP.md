# Demo Account Setup (Development Only)

## Demo Credentials
- **Email:** demo@recipeandme.app
- **Password:** DemoRecipes2024!

## Important: Supabase Configuration

To allow the demo account to work without email confirmation, you need to:

### Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Development Only)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication â†’ Settings
3. Under "Email Auth" section, toggle OFF "Confirm email"
4. Save changes

### Option 2: Use Supabase Inbucket (Local Development)
If running Supabase locally:
1. Access Inbucket at http://localhost:54324
2. Find the confirmation email for demo@recipeandme.app
3. Click the confirmation link

### Option 3: Manual Confirmation via SQL
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor after creating the account:
```sql
UPDATE auth.users 
SET email_confirmed_at = now() 
WHERE email = 'demo@recipeandme.app';
```

## Features

2. Go to http://localhost:3002/auth/sign-up or http://localhost:3002/auth/login
3. Click "Fill Demo Credentials" button (only visible in development)
4. Submit the form
