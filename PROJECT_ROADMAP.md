## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain 80% test coverage
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Conduct code reviews
- Document complex logic

### Database Migration Guidelines

#### Migration Best Practices
- **Naming Convention**: Use timestamp prefix `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql`
- **Atomic Migrations**: Each migration should be a single logical change
- **Reversible**: Include DOWN migrations for rollback capability
- **Idempotent**: Migrations should be safe to run multiple times
- **Tested**: Test migrations on local database before committing

#### Migration Workflow
1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Create new migration
   pnpm migrate:create add_recipe_nutrition
   
   # Apply pending migrations
   pnpm migrate:up
   
   # Check migration status
   pnpm migrate:status
   
   # Rollback last migration
   pnpm migrate:down
   ```

2. **Build Integration**
   ```json
   // package.json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "npm run migrate:up && next build",
       "migrate:create": "supabase migration new",
       "migrate:up": "node scripts/run-migrations.js",
       "migrate:down": "node scripts/rollback-migration.js",
       "migrate:status": "node scripts/check-migrations.js"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Migration Tracking**
   - Migrations are tracked in `schema_migrations` table
   - Each migration records: filename, checksum, applied_at
   - Build process checks for unapplied migrations
   - Prevents duplicate migration application

4. **Type Generation**
   ```bash
   # After migrations, regenerate types
   pnpm generate:types
   ```

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Pull requests run migrations in preview environment
   - Main branch deploys run migrations before deployment
   - Rollback plan documented for each migration
   - Migration success is verified before marking deployment complete

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for development
- Pull requests for all changes
- Squash commits on merge
- Tag releases properly
- Maintain changelog

### Deployment Strategy
- Continuous integration/deployment
- Staging environment testing
- Blue-green deployments
- Automated rollback capability
- Performance monitoring

This roadmap is designed to deliver a functional MVP in 18 weeks while maintaining high quality standards and setting the foundation for future enhancements.
