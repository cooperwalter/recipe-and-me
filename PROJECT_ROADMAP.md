- **Browser Compatibility**: Use progressive enhancement

### User Experience Risks
- **Complex UI**: Conduct user testing early
- **Data Loss**: Implement auto-save and versioning
- **Privacy Concerns**: Clear data ownership policies
- **Adoption Barriers**: Simple onboarding process

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain 80% test coverage
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Conduct code reviews
- Document complex logic

### Database Migration Guidelines

#### Migration Best Practices
- **Naming Convention**: Use timestamp prefix `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql`
- **Atomic Migrations**: Each migration should be a single logical change
- **Reversible**: Include DOWN migrations for rollback capability
- **Idempotent**: Migrations should be safe to run multiple times
- **Tested**: Test migrations on local database before committing

#### Migration Workflow
1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Create new migration
   pnpm migrate:create add_recipe_nutrition
   
   # Apply pending migrations
   pnpm migrate:up
   
   # Check migration status
   pnpm migrate:status
   
   # Rollback last migration
   pnpm migrate:down
   ```

2. **Build Integration**
   ```json
   // package.json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "npm run migrate:up && next build",
       "migrate:create": "supabase migration new",
       "migrate:up": "node scripts/run-migrations.js",
       "migrate:down": "node scripts/rollback-migration.js",
       "migrate:status": "node scripts/check-migrations.js"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Migration Tracking**
   - Migrations are tracked in `schema_migrations` table
   - Each migration records: filename, checksum, applied_at
   - Build process checks for unapplied migrations
   - Prevents duplicate migration application

4. **Type Generation**
   ```bash
   # After migrations, regenerate types
   pnpm generate:types
   ```

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Pull requests run migrations in preview environment
   - Main branch deploys run migrations before deployment
   - Rollback plan documented for each migration
   - Migration success is verified before marking deployment complete

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for development
- Pull requests for all changes
- Squash commits on merge
- Tag releases properly
- Maintain changelog

### Deployment Strategy
- Continuous integration/deployment
- Staging environment testing
- Blue-green deployments
- Automated rollback capability
- Performance monitoring

This roadmap is designed to deliver a functional MVP in 18 weeks while maintaining high quality standards and setting the foundation for future enhancements.

## Summary & Recommendations

### Current Project State (January 2025)
The Recipe Inheritance Keeper has successfully implemented core functionality exceeding the original MVP scope:
- ‚úÖ Complete recipe management system with CRUD operations

- ‚úÖ Voice-to-recipe creation and updates (beyond original scope)
- ‚úÖ Version tracking with full history (backend complete)
- ‚úÖ Authentication with demo mode
- ‚úÖ Responsive UI with print support

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete UI Implementation** for existing backend features (version history, tags, favorites page)
2. **Implement E2E Testing** with Playwright/Cypress for quality assurance
3. **Add Recipe Tools** (scaling, conversion, shopping lists) for better cooking experience
4. **Enable Sharing & Export** to fulfill the core mission of recipe preservation

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Focus on Family Features**: Prioritize features that strengthen family connections (stories, collaboration, heritage tracking)
2. **Improve Testing Coverage**: Implement comprehensive E2E and accessibility testing before adding new features
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add monitoring and optimize for larger recipe collections
4. **Mobile Experience**: Consider Progressive Web App (PWA) before native apps
5. **Community Building**: Add family collaboration features to increase engagement

The project has a solid foundation with impressive AI integration. The next phases should focus on completing the planned features while maintaining code quality and user experience.

  current_period_start: timestamp
  current_period_end: timestamp
  cancel_at_period_end: boolean
  stripe_subscription_id: string
  stripe_customer_id: string
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
}

Table: usage_tracking {
  id: uuid
  user_id: uuid
  resource_type: enum ('recipe', 'ocr_scan', 'voice_minute', 'storage_mb')
  usage_count: integer
  period_start: timestamp
  period_end: timestamp
}

#### Key Implementation Features

- Special discount for trial conversion

**3. Billing Features**
- **Proration**: When upgrading/downgrading mid-cycle

**4. Enterprise/Custom Pricing**

### Pricing Psychology & Best Practices

**1. Price Anchoring**
- Show annual savings prominently (2 months free)
- Display per-day cost ($0.16/day for Premium)
- Compare to physical cookbook cost

**2. Value Communication**
- "Preserve 100 years of recipes for less than a cookbook"
- "Share with 6 family members for the price of 2 coffees"
- Highlight cost of losing family recipes

**3. Promotional Strategies**
- **Launch**: 50% off first year for early adopters
- **Seasonal**: Mother's Day, Thanksgiving promotions
- **Referral**: Give a month, get a month
- **Bundle**: Discount for annual payment

**4. Free Tier Optimization**
- Generous enough to be useful
- Limited enough to encourage upgrades
- Focus limits on features that cost money (AI/storage)
- Never paywall core value (recipe storage/viewing)
