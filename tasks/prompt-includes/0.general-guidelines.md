# Task Guidelines - General

- Whenever completing a task, always check if the task is already completed. If so, report this fact, and mark the task as completed.
- Before starting a task, always generate a plan for the task. Generate this plan by surveying the codebase, reviewing relevant files, carefully reading the task documentation, and any other relevant information. After creating a plan, don't stop. Begin working on the task.
- After completing a task, always review your work. Return to the task file and check the context and task description. Perform a final check to verify that you have completed all tasks. If relevant, run related tests to verify that your work is correct.
- If asked to complete an entire task document, complete each task item one-at-a-time. Ensure that each task item is completed before moving on to the next one.
- After completing a task, please move it to the `completed` folder (`tasks/completed/`)
- Always use the latest versions of any technologies or tools you are using. If the current version is not the latest, do not update it without being prompted to do so.
- When creating a new task file, always at a minimum include a TODO section. Furthermore, ensure the name of the file increments the number of the task and does not have the same number as another task.
- Whenever asked to complete a task, always create a task markdown file.
- Always update the task file with the results of your work.
