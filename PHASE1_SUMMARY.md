# Phase 1: Foundation & Core Data Models - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Vitest Configuration
- Installed and configured Vitest as the testing framework
- Set up test environment with happy-dom
- Created test setup file with Next.js and Supabase mocks
- Added test scripts to package.json
- Achieved 100% test pass rate (38 tests)

### ✅ Database Schema Design
- Created comprehensive schema for all recipe-related tables:
  - `recipes` - Main recipe table with versioning support
  - `ingredients` - Recipe ingredients with measurements
  - `instructions` - Step-by-step cooking instructions
  - `recipe_photos` - Photo attachments for recipes
  - `recipe_categories` - Category definitions
  - `recipe_category_mappings` - Recipe-to-category relationships
  - `recipe_tags` - Custom tags for recipes
  - `recipe_versions` - Version history tracking
  - `favorites` - User favorites

### ✅ Database Migrations
- Created three migration files with proper date stamps:
  - `20250613000000_initial_schema.sql` - Core tables and indexes
  - `20250613000001_rls_policies.sql` - Row Level Security policies
  - `20250613000002_storage_buckets.sql` - Storage bucket configuration
- Added migration automation scripts (pending Supabase CLI setup)
- Integrated migration checks into build process

### ✅ Row Level Security (RLS)
- Implemented comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
- Users can only view/edit their own recipes (unless public)
- Proper access control for related data (ingredients, photos, etc.)
- Public read access for categories

### ✅ TypeScript Type Definitions
- Created complete type definitions in `lib/types/recipe.ts`
- Includes input types for creating/updating recipes
- Search and filter parameter types
- Response types with relations

### ✅ CRUD Operations Implementation
- Created `RecipeService` class with full CRUD functionality
- Supports all recipe operations:
  - Create, read, update, delete recipes
  - Manage ingredients and instructions
  - Handle categories and tags
  - Toggle favorites
- Includes search and filtering capabilities
- Proper error handling throughout

### ✅ API Route Handlers
- Created RESTful API endpoints:
  - `GET/POST /api/recipes` - List and create recipes
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/recipes/[id]` - Single recipe operations
  - `POST /api/recipes/[id]/favorite` - Toggle favorite status
- Full authentication checks
- Comprehensive request/response handling

### ✅ Storage Configuration
- Created storage buckets for recipe photos and original cards
- Implemented `StorageService` class with:
  - File upload/download/delete operations
  - Image optimization capabilities
  - File validation (size and type)
  - Batch upload support
- Storage policies for secure access

### ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- All services have complete test coverage
- Mock implementations for Supabase client
- Tests for error scenarios and edge cases
- Seed data validation tests

### ✅ Seed Data
- Created comprehensive seed data file
- Includes sample recipes with all relations
- Uses `auth.uid()` for proper user references
- Ready for development testing

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **No ORM**: Using Supabase client directly for better integration with RLS and real-time features
2. **Colocated Tests**: Test files are placed next to implementation files
3. **Service Pattern**: Business logic encapsulated in service classes
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for all data structures
5. **Migration Automation**: Build process includes migration checks

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on the PROJECT_ROADMAP.md, the next phase will focus on:
- Basic UI components (Recipe list and detail views)
- Manual recipe entry form
- Basic search and filtering UI
- Responsive design implementation

## Dependencies Added

- `vitest` - Testing framework
- `@vitest/ui` - UI for test runner
- `@testing-library/react` - React testing utilities
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - DOM matchers
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `happy-dom` - DOM implementation for tests
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` - React plugin for Vite
- `dotenv` - Environment variable handling
- `supabase` - Supabase CLI (for migrations)

## Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key (for migrations)
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id (for type generation)
```

## Testing Summary

- **Total Tests**: 38
- **Test Files**: 4
- **Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Coverage**: All core functionality tested

Phase 1 is now complete with a solid foundation for the Recipe Inheritance Keeper application!
